## Abstract

It is a daunting task to phrase the established taxonomy of missing data mechanisms in order to provide a practical guide to working with missings of time series. Can missing data speak the language of the data that goes beyond the mechanisms: MCAR, MAR, MNAR? We take a different route to understanding and developing missing types in temporal context with the focus of data. We exploit how the new types of temporal missings can leave the trace in many types of plots so that we can reason about the decisions made for handling and imputing missing values. The work will be implemented in the **mists** package using R.
