\usage{
na_polish_metrics(before, after)
}
\arguments{
\item{before, after}{Tsibbles before and after polishing.}
}
\value{
A tibble contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{prop_na} & \code{nobs_na}: The proportion of \code{NA}s in the sliced data
(the difference between \code{before} and \code{after}).
\item \code{prop_removed}, \code{nobs_removed}, \code{nrows_removed}, & \code{ncols_removed}: The
proportion of removed observations over the overall observations.
}
}
\description{
Report metrics for missing data polishing
}
\details{
The metric used for measuring the effect of polishing events is
\code{prop_na * prop_removed}. We'd like to minimise the loss by minimising both
\code{prop_na} and \code{prop_removed} over sequential polishing events.
